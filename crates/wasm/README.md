# `@citeproc-rs/wasm`

This is a build of `citeproc` that is suitable for use in Node.js, a browser or 
a Firefox/Chromium-based application like Zotero. It consists of a WebAssembly 
(WASM) binary, and a fairly lightweight JavaScript wrapper for that binary. 

README for newer version of the API forthcoming.
