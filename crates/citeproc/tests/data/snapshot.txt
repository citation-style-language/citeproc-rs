# The issue variable is not mentioned in the spec as needing its hyphens replaced.
# The underlying problem is that cs:number is dramatically underused, mostly
# because you have to remember whether or not each variable is a number

# ˀ and ˁ do not have a decomposition in Unicode 12.1.
# ۥ and ۦ don't either, but they also manage not to appear in the web results viewer
#         probably because of a font issue (they're Arabic).
# The rest are correct and haven't changed since the list linked to in the test
# was prepublished. There are others which should also be included but there's
# not much point writing a test for code autogenerated from the actual unicode
