[Full Changelog](https://github.com/zotero/citeproc-rs/compare/ffi-v1.0.0...ffi-v1.0.1)

#### Fixed bugs:

`set_cluster_order` was subject to some changes made for FFI, attempting to
return an error when a non-existent cluster was listed in the desired order.
The bugfix separates the "list of clusters in order" and the "set of all known
cluster ids". Previously, an error would be erroneously returned if you called
~ `setClusterOrder([1])` and then `setClusterOrder([2]),` because the first
call had overwritten "all known cluster ids".
